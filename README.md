## üß™ Pipeline Overview

### 1. Data Ingestion (Google Cloud Storage)
- Create GCS buckets with `Cancer/` and `Non-Cancer/` folders
- Upload images using `google-cloud-storage` library
- Convert unsupported formats (TIFF) to JPEG/PNG
- Automate ingestion with **Cloud Functions**
- Enable **GCS versioning** and validate upload integrity

### 2. Preprocessing (Apache Spark)
- Resize images to 128x128 resolution
- Normalize pixel values to [0, 1]
- Use **Spark on Dataproc** for distributed preprocessing
- Save processed outputs to GCS for training

### 3. Feature Engineering
- Flatten images for traditional ML input
- Normalize and reduce dimensions using PCA
- Extract deep features using pre-trained CNN (e.g., ResNet)
- Store features in BigQuery or GCS

### 4. Model Training
- Input: 128x128x3 MRI images  
- Architecture: Custom CNN  
- Loss Function: Binary Cross Entropy  
- Optimizer: Adam  
- Metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC  
- Environment: TensorFlow with GPU/TPU support  
- Split: Train/Validation/Test from preprocessed GCS data

### 5. Deployment
- Build an interactive UI with **Streamlit**
- Integrate the trained CNN for real-time inference
- Deploy on **Google Cloud Run** for scalability and accessibility

### 6. Testing & Validation
- Use **Grad-CAM** to highlight regions influencing predictions
- Perform end-to-end validation: ingestion ‚Üí prediction
- Conduct stress tests and latency evaluations

### 7. Results
- Accuracy: ~95%  
- Precision: 93%  
- Recall: 94%  
- AUC-ROC: 0.96  
- Visual insights via Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Grad-CAM overlays

### 8. Maintenance & Scalability
- Enable model retraining with new data
- Monitor dashboard uptime and model accuracy
- Plan for HIPAA-compliant extensions and HIS/EMR integration
